        Would you like to learn a bit more about the universe of Asgard? Today we bring you at the heart of its theme, in the Norse mythology. To start discovering the world of Thor and Odin you would need to become familiar with a North Germanic language with
        words, syllables and letters that we are not used to dealing with. Svartalfheim is a good example. It's a whole lexicon to understand, a detailed world to discover. All artifacts, creatures, places have their own names and stories. For example
        Odin rides his eight-legged horse named Sleipnir, he is armed with his spear Gungnir and when he is in his palace in Valhalla, two ravens Hugin and Munin whisper in his ear what they saw of the nine worlds while two wolves, Geri and Freki, remain
        at his feet
