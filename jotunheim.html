            From Jötunheimr, the jötnar menace the human race in Midgard and the gods in Asgard. <br> The river Ífingr separates Asgard, the realm of the gods, from Jötunheimr, the land of giants. Gastropnir, the protection wall for the home of Menglad,
            and Þrymheimr, home of Þjazi, were both located in Jötunheimr, which was ruled by King Þrymr. <br> Glæsisvellir was a location in Jötunheimr, where lived the giant Gudmund, father of Höfund. Utgard was a stronghold surrounding the land of
            the giants,[1] but in Nordic languages, “Jötunheimr” is also simply a name for the realm of giants. <br>[1][2]ðavellir has often been interpreted as one of the Nine Worlds of Norse legend. <br> The problem is that both Nidavellir and Svartalfheim
            are mentioned, and it is unclear if the sixth world is a world of dwarfs or one of dark elves.
