            What was Helheim? It was the place located in the last level of the Nordic cosmos, in the world of Niflheim.
            <br> It is the dark, icy and totally foggy abode where those who die in conditions other than death in battle go.
            <br> It is a place from which you cannot leave once you pass through the gates that lead to it, not even the gods can leave.
            <br> Who goes to Hel? To this place go those who die of disease or old age, as well as those who have committed crimes and are condemned by the gods to Helheim.
            <br> Who or what was Garm? Garm is the monstrous hound that guards the entrance to Helheim, along with the giant Hraesvelg or "corpse-eater".
